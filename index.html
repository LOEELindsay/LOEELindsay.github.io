								<p>Hello there, I'm Efua. 
								<p>I am a Believer in Jesus Christ, a Certified Soul Care Practitioner and Coach with a Master’s in Public Health, mandated by God to heal souls. 

								<p>Looking back at my life, I realize that for years I felt like I was an imposter of my true self. I was trapped in a hamster wheel contained in a self-made fortress. Wanting to be free, but not knowing how. But God did!! He led me to those He prepared to be instrumental in helping me to be free. I am now a free woman, healed, continuing to heal, growing, and allowing myself, my true self to be; to be vulnerable; to be whole; to be authentic; to be loved and to love unconditionally. 

								<p>My healing and freedom is allowing me as propelled by Jesus Christ to help others do the same. With this new freedom, how can I keep it to myself? Out of that desire to share with others, God has entrusted me with Journey to Kingdom to be able to help and serve you. I am eternally thankful to God, for my healing journey and for giving me the opportunity and honor to walk alongside you on your own journey of soul care, healing and freedom...a Journey to "His" Kingdom </p>

								<p>My pledge to you is that by partnering with God and with Him as my guide, I will, serve as your guide, encourager, supporter and a catalyst to help you prepare for your healing journey, a life of wholeness and a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ as He rearranges, reforms, heals, transforms your story and your journey, revealing His love and ways to you.</p>
